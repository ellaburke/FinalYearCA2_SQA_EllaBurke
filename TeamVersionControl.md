# Gitflow WorkFlow for Team Version Control

Team version control is practicing the tracking and managing of changes to a teams code. Version control systems are software tools that allow a team to manage the changes made to its code through out the course of a sprint. The idea behind it is to keep track of every change made to the code and be able to revert back to an earlier version of the code in the event of an error. 

Gitflow is a Git workflow for continuous software development. The Gitflow workflow defines a branching model around the project release and follows continuous delivery. It assigns specific roles to different branches and how they should interact with each other. The idea behind Gitflow is to make parallel development by isolating new code from production code. Developers add new code on feature branches and the changes on these branches are only merged into the main branch once pull requests to do so have been approved. 

Feature branches are branched off of the development branch, and then once the features are complete they are merged back into the develop branch, this allows multiple developers to be working on the same task. When it is time for a sprint release, a release branch is created from develop. The code in this release branch can be tested independentally before merging into the master branch(and the develop branch as thats the branch in between). A Hotfix branch is a branch for emergency fixes on the released code. When the error has been fixed this branch gets merged back into main and develop.

In this project, to follow the GitFlow process I created a develop branch off of the main branch and then a feature branch off the develop branch. Although this was a solo project, in the case that I needed help on a topic it would make sense that I was working on a feature branch so both me and another person could be working on the same task. Then when our work was complete we would merge both our feature branches into the develop branch, ready for release. This project requires documentation on multiple topics such as "Scrum sprint backlog and task estimation", "Team version-control", "Unit testing and Test-Driven development" etc. All of these topics are required to go in the one README file. So for the purpose of explaining the Gitflow process in this project, each topic in the README file was its own feature branch. By creating these seperate feature branches, for different tasks, this allowed different tasks to be carried out and once pull requests were approved, all work was put into the README file. In the working world, each task may be assigned to a different developer, and therefore they could all be creating work for the read me file seperately.
