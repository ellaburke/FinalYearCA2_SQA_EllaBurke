# Test-driven Development

Test-driven development is an approach where you write a test before you write the code to fulfill that test. The goal of test-driven development is to write clean code, therefore getting the developer to think about the requirements of the task 
before writing the functional code. Test cases are written and tested and then if the test fails, new code is written
until the code passes the test. Test-driven development follows the approach that only write code if a test has failed to avoid 
duplication.
